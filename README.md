## Ed Cope

_DRAFT_
I am an enthusiastic and agile software developer/engineer in training, looking for opportunities to work on progressive technologies, whilst expanding my technical skillset and problem solving capabilities.

A consistent interest in creative approaches and how things work, led me to graduating in subjects involving 3D graphics at university, work opportunity and even international experience.
Encountering many technical challenges in this field, encouraged me to want to **write more code!** Consequently, I joined Makers Academy 16 week software bootcamp to become a more complete engineer/developer and take a (hopefully big) step into tech.
