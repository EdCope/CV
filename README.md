## Ed Cope

_DRAFT_
I am an enthusiastic and agile software developer/engineer in training, looking for opportunities to work on progressive technologies, whilst expanding my technical skillset and problem solving capabilities.

A consistent interest in creative approach and how things work, led me to graduating in subjects involving 3D graphics at university, work opportunity and even international experience.
Encountering many technical challenges in this field, encouraged me to want to **write more code!** Consequently, I joined Makers Academy bootcamp to become a more complete engineer/developer and take a (hopefully big) step into tech.

## EMPLOYMENT

### **Sonoco-Trident** (November 2014 to November 2021)  
_Technical CGI Artist_

More complicated production work, assistant to artists, supervisor of department technology and developing workflow improvements

-	Developed scripts to bundle files and queue for rendering (Python)
- Prototyped Automation for Packshots (**Python** - modo/Deadline **Javascript** - Photoshop)
- Deployed render farm for off loading processing and maintained servers involved.

#### _Previous Role_
_CGI Artist_

Production worker creating images, assets and short films using/creating 3D Models, packaging artworks for use on digital platforms.
<!-- - Any experience, including roles and responsibilities and results achived in bullet point format. -->

### **Dav-It GmbH** (March 2013 to September 2013)
_3D Internship_

Internship after studying at Reutlingen University (Germany) as part of Erasmus scholarship. Achieved as part of my sandwich BSc degree.

<!-- - Any experience relevent to software development -->

## SKILLS
COMING SOON
_Currently ideas from previous work but perhaps should apply to Makers projects_

<!-- Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result? -->


#### Analytical & Efficient
DRAFT
Whilst employed in a production environment, there were numerous aspects of the pipeline that could be optimised. Often there were bottlenecks in areas such as rendering/processing and repetitive worker tasks.
After analysing this I demonstrated areas that could be improved. With backing I setup a renderfarm and began to learn python to simplify the workflow and interface for the artists working with it.
The result was saving lot of production hours and generated an ambition to continue to code - experiencing how useful programming could be.

<!-- - Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR) -->

#### Adaptable Learner
Transferring between many projects in my career and studies, has given me exposure to many software applications. 
To complete projects with often niche requirements I would have to
learn software quickly to achieve the desired outcome.
An example of this would be creating fluid simulations for 3D animation requiring software for simulating, importing geometry, scene construction and post-production individually.

DRAFT

<!-- Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.) -->

## EDUCATION
