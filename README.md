## Ed Cope

I am an enthusiastic and adaptable software engineer in training, looking for opportunities to work on progressive technologies, whilst expanding my technical skillset and problem solving capabilities.

A consistent interest in creative approach and how things work, led me to graduating in subjects involving 3D graphics at university, work opportunity and even international experience.
Encountering many technical challenges in this field, encouraged me to want to **write more code!** Consequently, I joined [Makers Academy](https://www.makers.tech/hire/) bootcamp to become a more complete engineer and take a (hopefully big) step into tech.

## SKILLS

<!-- Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result? -->


#### Analytical & Efficient
Whilst employed in a production environment, there were numerous aspects of the pipeline that could be optimised. Often there were bottlenecks in areas such as rendering/processing and repetitive worker tasks.
After analysing this I demonstrated areas that could be improved. With backing I setup a renderfarm and began to learn python to simplify the workflow and interface for the artists working with it.
The result was saving lot of production hours and generated an ambition to continue to code - experiencing how useful programming could be.

<!-- - Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR) -->

#### Adaptable Learner
Transferring between many projects in my career and studies, has given me exposure to many software applications. 
To complete projects with often niche requirements I would have to
learn software quickly to achieve the desired outcome.
An example of this would be creating fluid simulations for 3D animation requiring software for simulating, importing geometry, scene construction and post-production individually.

#### Team Player
Regularly I have worked in teams to breakdown complex projects with a large scope or a short deadline. This was tested a lot during my training at Makers. We completed multiple group projects within a week or 2. As our teams were full of students, it was sometimes challenging to know how comfortable all members would be with a tech stack or programming concept. The way we worked around this was to make sure we scheduled multiple check-ins every day to allow people to discuss what they felt they needed to learn and if they were struggling. As a result we could reorganise what people were working on increasing the feeling of contribution and ultimately produce a more complete project.

<!-- Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.) -->

## EDUCATION

### Makers Academy (December 2021 to Current)
Intensive software engineering Bootcamp preparing a Full-Stack development skillset.

-	Gained confidence in multiple languages and frameworks used in web development.
-	Frequent group work and pair programming encouraged communication and teamwork to achieve results. 
-	Utilised Test-Driven Development as a foundation for our process.
-	Developed an understanding of how to learn and research in this field and also techniques to manage wellbeing doing so.
-	Learnt object-orientated design principles.

<!-- - Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problemsolve effeciently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine -->
